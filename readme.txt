  HyperActive.ConsoleApp:    A place to play with my "Hyper" creations and show them off.
    The most active one currently is HyperJS - JavaScript in C#.
    
	This project includes the Image class added to the JS global object as a C#
	extension method and uses closures for private variables and object scope!

    In theory, most of this should end up in UnitTest projects to demonstrate
    that this stuff actually works!  (Slowly migrating as I have more time...)
